    You weren't the boy I thought I knew<br>
Maybe I was blind, I was young<br>
I didn't have a clue<br>
You were the topic of my lunch times<br>
I'd bore the girls about our chats<br>
And get upset when you didn't text back<br>
<p></p>
I was warned by my brothers<br>
To find another lover<br>
Stop falling for these boys<br>
Who didn't want the same as me<br>
<p></p>

We all want a teenage fantasy<br>
Want it when we can't have it<br>
When we got it we don't seem to want it<br>
We all want a teenage fantasy<br>
Want it when we can't have it<br>
When we got it we don't seem to want it<br>
<p></p>
I've got a lot of things to do<br>
What if I had been a fool<br>
And thought I was in love with you?<br>
I need to grow and find myself<br>
Before I let somebody love me<br>
Because at the moment I don't know me<br>
<p></p>
When I was told by my father<br>
If I look into the future<br>
Do I really see this boy<br>
That I think I've fallen for?<br>
<p></p>
And I was told by my mother<br>
If I look into the future<br>
Do I really see this boy<br>
That I think I've fallen for?<br>

We all want a teenage fantasy<br>
Want it when we can't have it<br>
When we got it we don't seem to want it, no<br>
We all want a teenage fantasy<br>
Want it when we can't have it<br>
When we got it we don't seem to want it<br>
<p></p>
When we are young<br>
We all want someone<br>
Who we think is the one<br>
Just to fit in<br>
<p></p>
There's no need to rush<br>
Take your time<br>
Life's a big old ride<br>
Sit back and enjoy the vibe<br>
