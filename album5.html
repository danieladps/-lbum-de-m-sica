<h3 class="h">Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now<br>
    Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same<br>
    When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down<br>
    ‘Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name<br>
    It all just sounds like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh<br>
    <p></p>
    Hmm, too young, too dumb to realize<br>
    That I should’ve bought you flowers and held your hand<br>
    Should’ve gave you all my hours when I had the chance<br>
    Take you to every party, ‘cause all you wanted to do was dance<br>
    Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man<br>
    <p></p>
    My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways<br>
    Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life<br>
    Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh<br>
    And it haunts me every time I close my eyes<br>
    It all just sounds like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh<br>
    <p></p>
    Hmm, too young, too dumb to realize<br>
    That I should’ve bought you flowers and held your hand<br>
    Should’ve gave you all my hours when I had the chance<br>
    Take you to every party, ‘cause all you wanted to do was dance<br>
    Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man<br>
    <p></p>
    Although it hurts<br>
    I'll be the first to say that I was wrong<br>
    Oh, I know I'm probably much too late<br>
    To try and apologize for my mistakes<br>
    But I just want you to know<br>
    <p></p>
    I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand<br>
    Give you all his hours when he has the chance<br>
    Take you to every party<br>
    ‘Cause I remember how much you loved to dance<br>
    <p></p>
    Do all the things I should’ve done<br>
    When I was your man<br>
    Do all the things I should’ve done<br>
    When I was your man<br>
